Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
--Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on
-- We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 Types of Alerts:
1) Web-based alerts- we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2)JavaScript alerts/browser alerts-we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                  -we cannot inspect it
3)Windows-based alerts-we cannot handle with selenium

Types of JavaScript alerts
1)Simple Alert-Click ok
2)Confirmation Alert-either cancel or click
3)Prompt Alert-Enter the text and then click ok

To handle JavaScript alerts we only have 4 methods
1) accept()- click ok
2) dismiss()- click cancel
3)getText()-returns text
4) sendKeys()

To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in url
-- username:password@--> after https://

Frames
--Frame is a seperate independent window in our webpage
--Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with frames
1)By index
2) By name/ID
3)By WebElement


In Alerts- switch to alert and switch automatically back
In Frames- switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page
